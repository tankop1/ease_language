## Ease - The Easy Language
A Project by Tanner Kopel


Simply run the shell.py file, and enter your code into the command line like below.

```python
ease >>> #CODE HERE
ease >> 3 + 3 * (8 - 2)
```

Right now, the command line is only in the lexer stage, so the output will only be the token value pairs.
Checkback soon for a fully developed language!

I hope you enjoy!
